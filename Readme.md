# UE23CS241B : Design and Analysis of Algorithms Code Notebook (Jan-May Semester 4, 2025)

## Overview

This folder serves as my **personal code notebook** for the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** course during the **Jan-May Semester 4, 2025**. It contains a mix of personal practice code, university-provided materials, and other resources.

### Important Notes:

- All the folders are for my **personal practice and experimentation**.
- The code in **ClassCodes and HandsOnCodes** and other practice folders may be **incorrect**, **unoptimized**, or **incomplete**. Refer to it **with caution**.
- The code in **HackerrankLabCodes and the JOB Problems** are oficially submitted codes and are accurate to the best of my knowledge.
